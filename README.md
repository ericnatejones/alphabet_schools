# Alphabet Schools Studio

An innovative open-source platform where students learn by building interconnected asset creation tools.

## Vision

Alphabet Schools Studio is both an educational platform and a creative ecosystem. Students learn development by building actual tools used by creators, while users gain access to an ever-growing suite of interconnected creative applications.

Assets created in one tool (like a character designer) can seamlessly flow into another tool (like a map maker) without downloads or conversions, creating a frictionless creative experience.

## Key Features

- **Interconnected Creative Tools**: D&D map makers, RPG engines, town simulators, character creators, and more
- **Seamless Asset Sharing**: Assets persist across all platform tools without manual exports/imports
- **Educational Framework**: Progressive schools from AI to Innovation, taught by alumni in monthly cohorts
- **Community Engagement**: Showcases, achievements, mentorship, and collaborative workspaces
- **Creator Ownership**: Optional NFT integration for creators to maintain ownership of their creations
