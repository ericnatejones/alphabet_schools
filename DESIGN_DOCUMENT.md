# Alphabet Schools Studio - Design Document

## Vision
Alphabet Schools Studio is an innovative educational platform where students learn by building asset creation tools that work together in a shared ecosystem. The platform serves dual purposes: educating students through practical development while creating a suite of interconnected creative tools for end users.

## Core Concepts

### Educational Framework
- **Learning by Building**: Students learn development by creating actual tools used by real users
- **Progressive Schools**: AI School → Business School → Code School → Dedication School → Earn School → Financial School → Gratitude School → Hosting School → Innovation School → Journey School → Kindness School → Leadership School → Mastery School → Network School → Opportunity School → Purpose School → Quietude School → Resilience School → Stewardship School → Timing School → Understanding School → 5 School (Five pillars. Five values. Fifth gear.) → Wisdom School → Xenium School (The ancient gift — generosity reborn.) → Yield School (Know when to push, when to pause.) → Zenith School (The peak. The perspective. The point.)

- **Cohort System**: Week-long cohorts running monthly, with 6-12 month access for paying students
- **Alumni Teaching**: Students must take courses from alumni of previous courses, creating a sustainable knowledge pipeline

### Technical Architecture
- **Shared Asset Ecosystem**: Assets created in one tool are accessible across all platform tools
- **Seamless Integration**: No file downloads required between tools (e.g., from image cropping to filtering)
- **Unified Storage**: Assets persist across the domain with shared protocols for access
- **Asset Ownership**: Optional NFT integration for creators to maintain ownership of their creations
- **Cross-Domain Compatibility**: Standardized asset protocols allowing interoperability
